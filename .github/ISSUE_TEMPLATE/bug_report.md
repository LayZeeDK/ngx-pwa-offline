Hi,

# Checks before posting an issue

- [ ] I have read all the library's documentation:
  - [README](https://github.com/cyrilletuzi/ngx-pwa-offline/blob/main/README.md)
  - [CHANGELOG](https://github.com/cyrilletuzi/ngx-pwa-offline/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md)
- [ ] I have checked in already:
  - [opened issues](https://github.com/cyrilletuzi/ngx-pwa-offline/issues)
  - [closed issues](https://github.com/cyrilletuzi/ngx-pwa-offline/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed)
  - [questions answered](https://github.com/cyrilletuzi/ngx-pwa-offline/discussions/categories/q-a) in the new "Discussions" tab
- [ ] I understand I am writing to a *human being*, doing this open source project *unpaid*
- [ ] I will be involved in my own issue, by answering questions and informing if the issue is resolved
